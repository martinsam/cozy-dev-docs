# Introduction

Welcome to the **Cozy Developer Space**.

Here you’ll find everything you need to understand Cozy technically and to develop applications and konnectors.

The **technical level required** to read and understand this documentation is not over 9,000; you’ll roughly have to:

 * Understand how the web works (both **client** and **server** side)
 * Read/Write **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS**
 * Install and run a **Node.js** process
 * Be comfortable with **command-line** calls
 * Know that cookies are not made of flour


```javascript
console.log(" ╰(◕‿◕)╯ ");
```


## Why & How we made Cozy

![Home Screenshot](images/home-screenshot.jpg)

Cozy is a **personal web deployment platform**, which enables you to quickly bootstrap applications and interact with your data. It stands on a server - between your application and the operating system - easying the pain of **system administration**, **web development** and **security**. Get your data back home!

### Data-oriented

The initial idea was to create a space where developers can **experiment and play with their data**, while remaining in control of the platform. A friendly centralized point to fetch data from Things-Of-Internet, devices and personal services.

More than a simple Platform-as-a-Service, Cozy puts the cloud back where it belongs: at home.

### Tools

Cozy also became our **daily working environment**, and we want it to be as comfortable as possible. It means that we require it flexible, extensible and usable. We use **Node.js** and **CouchDB** as our main technologies.

![Node JS](images/nodejs.jpg)

**Node.js** is a great and modern engine with a huge community of module creators. It has elvoved along with the GitHub's Open-Source popularization and is now wide-spread in the Web industry. Aside from being heavily maintained, it remains fun to extend and play with.

![CouchDB](images/couch.jpg)

**CouchDB** is surely less-known, but definitely reliable. As a proper Erlang program, it has proven its strength and stability. A consistent, well-documented API, plus wonderful replication capabilities: the recipe of what we love on a database engine.



## Developing with Cozy


“ *Cozy has been a great opportunity for me to start coding. Now I run a decent business.* ”
<small>Bill Getas - Startup entrepreneur</small>

“ *Thanks to Cozy, I successfully managed to build a working web application without a hassle.* ”
<small>Tim Bernee-Lers - enthusiast web developer</small>

“ *I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.* ”
<small>HAL 9000 - CoffeeScript compiler</small>


But to be honest, we don't need those fancy words to convince you to develop on Cozy.


### To the future, Marty!

Cozy is a **modern web platform** that abstracts a lot of complexity out of personal **data manipulation**. If you are planning on developing a tool to **fetch**, **visualize** or **mix data**, a Cozy Application or a Konnector may be a good way to start.

By developing on Cozy, you will:

 * Reach a community of **enthusiast testers** and end-users
 * Learn how to make **single-page applications** with modern JavaScript frameworks like **Angular.js** or **React.js**
 * Be guided by [Cozy mentors](#mentorship), JavaScript gurus and other contributors
 * Enjoy the **built-in security** of Cozy

And whatever the reason, you will always find a friendly team member to help you dealing with your struggles and questions on the [IRC channel](#irc).

**So let's dive into it**!


# Getting Started

This section is a quick tutorial showing off the different steps to start using Cozy as a development environment, making a simple app, and interact with your data.

## Set up the Development Environment

Since Cozy is made from several pieces, we wrapped it into an **easy-to-use Virtual Machine**, so you don't clutter your local system. That also means you can use the operation system you like! Well, there are obviously issues on Windows, so we will assume here that you use a **GNU/Linux system or Mac OS X**.

The environment is made of two parts: the Virtual Machine itself - a fully installed Cozy platform - and a local Node.js tool called `cozy-dev` which will help you getting started and deploying your app to your Cozy.

### 1. Install Git

 > On GNU/Linux, just install Git with your package manager

```shell
apt-get install git
```

 > On Mac OS, download the software here: <br>
 > <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">http://git-scm.com/download/mac</a>

```shell
# To check if Git is installed
git --version
```

The first step is obviously to install the development dependencies. Git is the [SCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) we use at Cozy, and if you don't know how to use it yet, don't worry: we will give example commands in the following tutorial.


### 2. Install Node.js

 > On Debian GNU/Linux Jessie, the proper version of Node.js is available in the official repositories

```shell
apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy npm
```

 > On other GNU/Linux systems, you can install Node.js manually by following
 > instructions from https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

 > On Mac OS X, simply download the package, and install it <br>
 > <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.3.0/node-v4.3.0.pkg">https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.3.0/node-v4.3.0.pkg</a>

```shell
# To check the Node.js version
node --version
```

Installing Node.js on your local environment is necessary to run your app and
use `cozy-dev`. Cozy runs well on <strong>Node.js v0.10</strong> and
<strong>Node.js 4.3</strong>, and you should install one of those versions.

You can find detailed instructions of installation on the [official page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


### 3. Install VirtualBox and Vagrant

**VirtualBox** is used to emulate a full Operating System in a Virtual Machine. You can download it from [The Virtualbox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

**Vagrant** is a Command-Line Interface to interact with VirtualBox and handle development environment easily. You can download it from [The Vagrant website](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

<aside class="notice">
On Debian GNU/Linux 8, <code>virtualbox</code> and <code>vagrant</code> are available in the official repositories.
</aside>


### 4. Install <code>cozy-dev</code>

```shell
# Use the -g option to install system-wide
sudo npm install -g cozy-dev
```

As mentionned above, `cozy-dev` is a set of tools aiming to help you managing your app deployment and your development environment. It is recommended to install it system-wide.

The full documentation of `cozy-dev` can be found below on the [related section](#cozy-development-environment).


### 5. Download and start the environment

```shell
# Create a development directory
mkdir cozy && cd cozy

# Download the environment
cozy-dev vm:init

# Start the environment
cozy-dev vm:start

# Check that the environment is properly started
cozy-dev vm:status

# Update the environment (strongly recommended)
cozy-dev vm:update
```

Use `cozy-dev` to initialize the environment.
It is recommended to **update it** at the end because we don't necessarily maintain the raw image in an up-to-date state, as a new version of Cozy can be released every couple of weeks ☺

<aside class="notice">
The command <code>cozy-dev vm:init</code> can take a few minutes to complete as it downloads the full environment. You only have to do it once though.

You should now be able to go to <a href="http://localhost:9104">http://localhost:9104</a>! ☺

## Introduction to Cozy Cloud architecture
Before writing code, let's have an overview of the Cozy Cloud architecture. The platform is made of 3 main components:

* the proxy handles user authentication. Your app won't have to deal with it, nor anything user related, because Cozy has a single user.
* the data system is a wrapper for CouchDB, which handles authorization and permission of applications when they access data.
* the pPaaS is what install, updated, uninstall, start and stop applications in the platform. You don't have to tink about deployment!

The Cozy Cloud architecture is detailed in a <a href="#architecture-and-components">specific part</a>.

# Write your own application

From this point onward, you have a choice to make :

## client-side application

If you want to make a simple app that only manipulate data inside the cozy (no sharing, no accessing an external API), head over to the <a href="./clientsideapp.html">Client-side apps section</a>

## Node.js application

If you want to make a powerfull app using node.js, which manipulate files, access remote APIs or allow access a cozy visitor with complex rules, go to the <a href="./nodeapp.html">Node.js app</a>
